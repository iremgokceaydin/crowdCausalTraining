<h1>Causal Crowd Coding</h1>
<h2>How To</h2>
<div style="width: 100%;float: left;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <p>Identifying causal knowledge contained in peopleâ€™s statements: some ground rules before you begin...</p>
    <h3>1. Causal knowledge is general.</h3>
    <p>Causal knowledge is generalized knowledge about how things (actions or properties) affect one another.  Generalized knowledge is knowledge that applies broadly, and is not about a specific event.

    A single post is likely to contain many distinct causal statements, and these may be more or less explicit.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>2. Causal statements have one or more causes and effects.</h3>
    <p>A single causal statement must contain at least one cause, and one effect, but there may be more than one of each.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>3. Posts may have the order of cause and effect reversed</h3>
    <p>Sometimes a post expresses cause and effect in a reverse order, so pay careful attention to what you identify as a cause and what you determine to be an effect.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>4. Questions can contain causal knowledge</h3>
    <p>Not all causal statements are direct. Sometimes a person might ask a question. Questions can be a way to express possible causal knowledge.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>5. Sometimes there are multiple causes leading to a single effect</h3>
    <p>In our case, this effect would be a symptom, since we're coding an asthma forum.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>6. Causal knowledge does not always appear in a single sentence!</h3>
    <p>Causal knowledge sometimes exhibits itself in more than once place throughout the post. Some people will write a lot in their post with a lot of context, so read carefully.</p>


    <hr>
    <h3>7. You may need to read a series of posts in order to understand the cause of a symptom and the effect of that symptom.</h3>
    <p>Meaning that you may have to read more than one post in the thread or forum to get the whole picture of what is going on.<br>
        For Example: Original Poster (OP), response, OP responds to responder, so on.</p><br>


    <h2>Usage Scenario</h2>
    <p>After you have read through posts and identified statements that express causal knowledge, you will need to identify variables that express a cause or effect.<br>
